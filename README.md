## Outcome
This project outcomes includes a single mobile application with crop disease detection, crop monitoring and farming recommendations.
* Farmer can take a picture of unhealthy leaf and app would detect the disease of the leaf.
* The application acts as a dashboard for the sensors deployed in the field and farmer can control actuators like water pump, sound sensor and LEDs from the application.
* Based on the data received from the sensors and the detected disease, the app will suggest what should be done next.
## Motivation
During my volunteer work at the Centre for Social Action, a socio-economic organization in CHRIST University, I had the opportunity to attend a camp in Kolar, a village situated near the border of Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka in India. During my three-day stay, I interacted with the villagers, who were all farmers, and discovered that there were several issues that required attention, but most of them were beyond my capacity to solve. Despite the camp being unrelated to academics, I identified a problem that I believed I could address. I observed that the majority of the villagers had limited knowledge about which fertilizers to use for their crops. Typically, they used 2-3 brands of fertilizers for each type of disease and applied the same chemical ratios to their crops, even when confronted with various diseases. This realization became the impetus for this project.

I lost most of my codes in my university drive. But the below resources contain most of the information about my work.
